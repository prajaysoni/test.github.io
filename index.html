	<p>The website I chose is the <a href="http://www.powerlifting-ipf.com/">International Powerlifting Federation</a></p>

		One thing that was confusing to me was the class attribute for the anchor tag. Take for example the social media icons in the header. From reading this code, I feel that the classes have built-in icons that appear when they are used. There is no other indication as to how the Facebook or Youtube icons appear.
	</p>
	<p>Something else I wasn't too sure of was the script element. I'm asuming that it is using some JavaScript functions we haven't learned yet.
	<p>In terms of aesthetic, I really like this site. It has the look many new websites are using these days: the large header that takes up the screen side-to-side with the dropdown menus for the different sections of the site.</p>
